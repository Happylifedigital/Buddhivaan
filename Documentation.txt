When app opens
it asks for user id and  password
when user enters the user id and the tag is present in firebase for user id , then the id gets stored in id label, which then on successful password verification 
store the id in tiny db id tag...

I also created another back end app where we can check for available school ids, add school , remove school from the list


Whenever i register a student i want following data with mentioned purpose:
student's class: every students class must be specified as (student_id:class_id) 
class's teachers list: (class_id_teachers:[no. of characters of 1st_teacher_id]_1st_teacherid_....upto all teachers
each teacher's assignment data: teacherid_assignment:[number of assignments]_assignment1name_assignment1link_assignment1submissiondate_...upto that number of assignments

First student login
- if on first login the student tiny db data with tag datalog is not yes then it will get its complete data from firebase about class teacher etc
- first it sets project bucket to Users and calleds student_id:class:id to get class id 
and then it stores class id in class_id tiny db
then it sets project bucket to class
and asks for teachers list
