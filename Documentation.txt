When app opens
it asks for user id and  password
when user enters the user id and the tag is present in firebase for user id , then the id gets stored in id label, which then on successful password verification 
store the id in tiny db id tag...

I also created another back end app where we can check for available school ids, add school , remove school from the list


Whenever i register a student i want following data with mentioned purpose:
student's id password: as (student_id: student_password)
student's class: every students class must be specified as (student_id_class:class_id) 

First student login
-
1) the tinydb stores username in username tag
2) firebase requests username_class
3) it stores username_class in username_class tinydb
4) firebase requests class_teachercount for number of teachers
5) it stores teacher_count in class_teachercount tinydb and also to variable i
6) firebase requests class_teacher_1 for first teacher id 
7) Once firebase receives first teacher id, i-1 takes place, id is stored in classid_teacher_1

The Firebase teacher count asks for number of teachers
stores that number in classid_teachers_count in tinydb

then firebase ask_teacher_list asks for first teacher data
and teachers_list_updated gets and stores data using recursive function within 
tinydb tag classid_teachers_0[count eg:1,2,3....]

at last when last teachers data is received: it will ask for schoolname for update purpose which contains unique school id
